# Buckyball-Ising-Model
---
We give the solutions for the Song-Shan-Hu Sping School Coding Challenge in this repo.

## Model Description

The anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on the Buckyball lattice.

## Results

1. We use several methods to give solutions for question 1.
2. For question 2, we find the dual problem of it in Graph Theory. We design the algorithm to find the degeneracy number N = 16000.
