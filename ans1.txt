Solutions of Q1>>
mean-field: 1.5000
Monte-Carlo (Wang-Landau): progrmming now
Tensor netowrk contraction: 0.102557925 (Our contraction sequence considers the geometry. The answer is not wright due to a small bug. The tensor network method is accurate and efficient.)
VAN: 1.1851153       (Need to tune super-parameters)
Quantum Circuit:  Need to learn more
