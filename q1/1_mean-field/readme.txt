    This program is to solve the self-consistent equation numerically. We will obtain the corresponding values of magmatization m at different temperature T values.
    We use the newton method to obtain the zero of the monotonic function.
    The natural units are choosed here.
    Note that the positive solution is obtained here.
    Ask Tiecheng for more details.
